# Alfajorcitos de Maizena (Grandma Elva)

This is the recipe for Alfajores as my grandma Nelida Elva Ramos used to make them.

## Ingredients

- 250 butter bread
- 185gr sugar
- 4 eggs
- 250gr of corn flour
- 385gr of wheat flour (self raising)
- Vanilla extract
- Grated lemon skin
- Table spoon of baking powder

### Dressing

- Dried coconut
- Dulce de Leche (for Europe, I recommend the [Mardel Cl√°sico](https://www.dulcedelechemardel.com/))

## Recipe

Mix the (cold) butter bread in a bowl with the 4 eggs and a slight of vanilla extract. Break the bread in a few parts and let it soak.

Add the sugar and keep on mixing and breaking, then add the grated lemond skin.

Mix the corn flour and (self raising) wheat flour and a table spoon of baking powder.

Start adding in batches of flour to the butter mix, joining everything together with your hands. Repeat the process until you get a semi-uniform yellow dough.

Coat the tray with a little bit of butter and put it in the oven. Pre-heat the oven to about 170 C degrees.

Break the dough into four big pieces, and knead with a pole into a thin piece (no more than 2mm width) and then use a circular mold (no bigger than 5.5cm in diameter) to shape the cookies.

Add as many as you can to the tray and bake for about 10 minutes in the middle of the oven, and then move to the bottom for the remainder 10 (this way, you can use to trays for uniform baking of all of them.) You want to take them out once the base of the cookies are a little bit on the orange coloring.

### Dressing

Once you've got all of your cookies ready and cooling off, you can then begin with the dressing.

Take a small bowl or plate and add a pile of dissecated coconut.

Grab one cookie put a spoon of dulce de leche in the middle and close with one of similar shape.

Then roll the alfajor on the dulce de leche side on the coconut pile a few times (applying a bit of pressure to make sure it sticks and closes.)

Finally, let them rest in the fridge for a few hours. This next step isn't strictly necessary, but it would help the dough hold everything together a bit better.

## And there you go!!!

Alfajores de Maizena, like the ones I've enjoyed helping my grandma Elva make throughout my childhood :smile:
